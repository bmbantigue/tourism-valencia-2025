For only ₱200, guests can step into this natural paradise surrounded by lush greenery, with pools brimming with cold spring water, free tables and chairs scattered across the grounds, and cozy tents or cottages available for groups.

              <h5 class="card-title">PULANGBATO FALLS</h5>
              <p class="card-text">The Pulangbato Falls of Valencia, whose name means “red rock” in the local dialect, is a natural wonder where a striking cascade flows into a basin surrounded by crimson stones, earning it the title of the “red princess.” While scientists have yet to determine the cause of the rocks’ unusual coloring, the waters remain clean, safe, and refreshingly cold. Developed by the Tourism Office of Valencia, the site continues to undergo improvements, offering chairs, tables, and sunbathing lounges for visitor comfort. Although the falls are geographically closer to Dumaguete City, most travelers begin their trip from the Valencia town plaza for convenience in exploring other tourist spots. Much like Forest Camp, Pulangbato features invigorating waters complemented by two manmade pools suitable for both children and adults, along with a small snack bar serving beverages, desserts, and simple meals—making it an ideal destination for a cool dip and a memorable eco‑tourism experience in Valencia.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The majestic Casaroro Falls in Valencia is a destination that both challenges and rewards its visitors, earning praise for its towering beauty while testing endurance with over 350 concrete steps and a rugged trek through boulders and flowing waters before reaching its tranquil cascade. Unlike other tourist spots in the municipality, Casaroro offers a more raw and untamed experience, with no tables or chairs at the main grounds—only comfort rooms along the way and cement blocks that serve as makeshift seating—making it wise to bring foldable chairs and towels for convenience. Though the demanding hike may discourage some, the sight of the falls instantly washes away fatigue, offering breathtaking scenery and the perfect photo opportunity that makes every step of the journey worthwhile.</p>

At the heart of the town, the plaza offers a lively playground, a basketball court, and a tennis court for visitors who enjoy being physically active. For those who simply want to relax, the plaza is surrounded by vibrant flowers and lush plants that create a refreshing atmosphere. As the day winds down, the plaza becomes even more inviting with the aroma of the town’s famous crispy and savory lechon belly, a must‑try delicacy that adds flavor to the Valencia experience.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">SULFUR VENTS IN PULANGBATO</h5>
              <p class="card-text">Sulfur Mountain in Pulangbato, Valencia, Negros Oriental is a fascinating natural attraction, famous for the constant steam rising from its surface that creates a misty, almost otherworldly effect perfect for photographs. While the fog‑like steam may look enchanting, it carries the distinct smell of rotten eggs due to the area’s high sulfur content, a reminder of the geothermal activity linked to the potentially active Mt. Talinis. Visitors should note that those with breathing or lung conditions are advised to avoid prolonged exposure, as the fumes can be harsh. The site itself features striking reddish rocks, giving Pulangbato its name (“red rock”), colored by sulfur deposits that add to its dramatic landscape. Often paired with a trip to the nearby Pulangbato Falls, the Sulfur Vents offer a unique glimpse into nature’s raw power, blending scenic beauty with the awe of volcanic energy.</p>
